# Mozo Design System

A design system built with **Storybook** and based on **[Bootstrap 5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/)** components and documentation.

## What's included

- **Components** — Buttons, Cards, Alerts, Badges, Breadcrumbs, Accordions, Forms, Modals, Navs, and more, following Bootstrap 5.3 markup and styles.
- **Documentation** — Each component includes usage notes and variants aligned with the [official Bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/).
- **Theme** — Bootstrap’s CSS (and optional JS for interactive components) is loaded in Storybook so you can see the default theme and customize it later.

## Getting started

1. **Browse components** in the sidebar under **Components**.
2. **Use the Controls** panel to try different props/variants where available.
3. **Copy code** from the Docs or Canvas tab to use in your app.
